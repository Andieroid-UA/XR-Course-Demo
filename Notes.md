How to build this thing on 3JS
=================================

Going to build each of the pages seperate... then join together. Then the little add ons.

## 11/8/23

Going to start with a base, and getting that cat tree project to work (had to delete my project and start from scratch)

<https://www.digitalinfoways.com/blog/three-js-scene-in-angular/>

<https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation>

    ng new angular-three

After you install CLI successfully, now install three.js as a dependency by typing the command- 

    cd angular-three

You can install three.js packages by using command as-

    npm install --save three

You can install the type definitions of three,js by typing- 

   npm install --save @types/three

---------

Okay! I have the following made:
- app.module.ts (to have the component TS files talking to each other)
- app-routing.module.ts (to change the pages, connect together)

=================================
It's not happy. Going to start over again. Going to try and get SOMETHING up...

OKAY! I have the base of the files from the nets. Going to reapply the app module and routing module now...
